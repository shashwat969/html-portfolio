<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Shashwat, a BTech student based in Gorakhpur. </p>

 <p> I'm currently diving deep into the world of technology, learning Web Development and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using Java.
 I'm passionate about building things that make a difference—whether it's a cool web app or a well-optimized solution to a complex problem.</p>

 <p>Apart from tech, I find joy in cooking and exploring new recipes. It's my creative escape and a way to unwind.
    Music is another big part of my life—it keeps me energized and focused, especially during coding sessions or while experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
  
 <p> I believe in continuously learning and improving myself, both personally and professionally.
   I'm on a journey to not only grow as a developer but also as a person.</p>
